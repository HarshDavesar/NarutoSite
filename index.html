    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            <big>Many people have told me to never give up and sometimes I tell myself that. However, one specific
                character I have seen lives and would die by that motto.
                His name is Naruto Uzumaki and he never backs down from any challenge, no matter what dangers face





                <br> Naruto is an anime, or Japanese cartoon, that shows the life and journey of Naruto himself. Naruto
                is an up and coming ninja who aspires to eventually become the village’s Hokage,
                or the leader of his village. However, Naruto has been cursed with the Nine Tailed Fox spirit as it was
                sealed in his body by the Fourth Hokage to save the village.As a result,
                Naruto is neglected by many villagers because he is different and has this demon inside of him. Naruto
                has found people who have accepted him though, such as his sensei,Kakashi,
                and his squad members Sasuke and Sakura.
                <br>
                One thing that makes Naruto special is his ability to never give up, no matter the circumstance. In
                battle, Naruto always has a determined, stern look in his eyes.
                He is almost smirking as if he knows he is going to win. He usually tends to try and throw his opponent
                off guard and try to strike first, no matter how formidable the foe is.
                Typically, Naruto will eventually tumble to the ground. Remarkably, he is able to stand such hard blows
                to his body, and his determination gives him immense strength.
                Naruto has said that he will, “never give up because that is his ninja way.” This allows Naruto to
                always have shot of winning any battle he is put in.
                <br>
                Another thing that makes Naruto so special is his determination to be better than his rivals. In battle,
                Naruto is constantly contemplating what he can do to be betterthan Sasuke.
                Naruto sees Sasuke as someone who is perfect in every aspect of being a ninja and envies him for it. So
                because of this, Naruto trains nonstop to learn new techniquesto
                impress Sasuke and others. <br>
                Naruto eventually learns to summon a very large battle toad that even had Sasuke questioning where he
                had learned that from. Naruto’s drive allows him to be the best
                ninja that he can possibly be.
                <br>
                One last thing that makes Naruto different from all the others is the enormous strength that is inside
                him. Unlike others, Naruto possesses two types of energies
                inside him because of the spirit that he has possessed ever since he was born.
                <br>
                The first is a normal type of energy that is light blue in color and just somewhat of a threat to an
                opponent. The second type is much more powerful energy.
                This energy is a dark, ominous, red energy that comes from the spirit inside him.
                <br>
                At first, just when Naruto was in danger, this power would become unleashed. Now, Naruto is able to
                harness and control this unusual power making him unstoppable.
                This energy changes Naruto’s appearance, as he grows fangs and claws and closely resembles a fox.
                The power makes him unbeatable and no match for any other ninja.

                Although Naruto seems like a knucklehead outside of battle,
                he is truly a warrior in battle because of his determination, rivalries, and his power. He is truly a
                special individual who I personally have looked up to for
                lessons in my own life.

        <div class="first-para">
            <p><big>On the surface, it isn't as powerful as even a basic Rasengan, but Naruto's Multi Shadow Clone technique has proven indispensable on several occasions.
One of the most memorable instances is during Naruto's fight with Pain, where Naruto unleashed countless copies of himself to help pacify the deadly Deva Path of Pain.
On top of that, Naruto's shadow clones can do almost anything Naruto himself can do, provided they have enough chakra to do it. 
This means that Naruto's Shadow Clone technique technically has no upper limit in usability.

<div class="second-para"><big>This is a larger iteration of Naruto's traditional Rasengan, though it's only as big as the Fourth Hokage's Rasengan. Also known as the Big Ball Rasengan, 
the Oodama Rasengan was first unleashed upon a copy of Itachi during the mission to rescue Kazekage Gaara. It is worth noting that Naruto's "regular" Rasengan
became as big as the Oodama Rasengan during the Naruto: Shippuden series.

                <br>
    <p>
<div class="third-para"><big>This was the first significant improvement upon the initial Rasengan technique. This skill reshaped the Rasengan to resemble a giant shuriken and was forged
after Asuma Sarutobi
helped Naruto master his control over the wind element. He unleashed it first upon the Akatsuki member, Kakuzu. The main hitch that made Rasenshuriken so
effective is that it cut its target on the molecular level,
and it proved effective in that fight against Kakuzu.

    <p>
    <big>
<div class="fourth-para">Unveiled during the initial phase of the Fourth Great Ninja War, the Planetary Rasengan is an advanced technique that utilizes three to four different Rasengan
 at once.
As Naruto Uzumaki forms a big Rasengan in the palm of his hand, it is further surrounded by 2-3 smaller Rasengan that revolve around it. 
Its power is such that just a single hit from this technique incapacitates a shinobi as strong as a Kage.
The Planetary Rasengan is a fearful technique that no shinobi would want to get hit with.

    <div class="fifth-para">
        <p><big>Naruto also released this attack during his fight with Pain. The quirk of this attack is that the Rasengan ball was formed to be as large 
as Naruto's body.
This is technically an expansion on the Oodama Rasengan but even larger. In other words, the bigger the Rasengan, the more destructive it is.</big></p>
